Hi — I’m **Dong Wang (王东)**, a Ph.D. candidate in Robotics at **Julius-Maximilians-University Würzburg (JMU)**, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Nüchter](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/robotics/team/nuechter/) and [Prof. Dr. Stefan May](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/person/may-stefan/). My research focuses on **SLAM and Spatial AI**. I design robust **sensor-fusion pipelines** (LiDAR, radar, cameras, IMUs, ultrasound) that enable mobile robots to localise and map reliably in the messy, dynamic conditions of the real world.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Robotics** from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, where I devised a 3-D route-planning framework for multi-UAV systems, and a joint **B.Sc.and B.Eng. in Mechatronics** from Tongji University and the Nuremberg Institute of Technology.

Alongside my doctoral studies I

* work as a **Research Assistant** at JMU, supervising undergraduate thesis projects,  
* lead the **AutonOhm** software team, winners at the RoboCup German Open Rescue 2021 and 2022 and 4 ᵗʰ place in Industrial @ Work 2023,  
* and serve as a **Software Developer** at **Evocortex GmbH** from 2020 to 2024, delivering perception and autonomy stacks for next-generation AMRs and UAVs.
