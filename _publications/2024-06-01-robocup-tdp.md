This paper presents the team AutonOhm and their solutions to the challenges of the RoboCup@ Work league. The hardware section covers the robot setup of Ωmnibot-V4 (Ωmeg4), which was developed using knowledge from previous robots used by the team. Custom solution approaches for the@ Work navigation, perception, and manipulation tasks are discussed in the software section, as well as a control architecture for the autonomous task completion. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
